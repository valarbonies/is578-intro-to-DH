## Description

I haven't used Archiviz before, or Omeka for that matter. But I know that many entry level DH projects and courses use it. Archiviz as a stack of plug-ins in Omeka is a DH tool that allows the user to digitize text documents, generate, edit and manage tags, and visualize and navigate their collection through an interactive knowledge graph.

## Additional Tool 

Another tool that I'd be interested in exploring because of its minimal computing principles is Alex Gil's Jekyll theme Ed. It was designed for textual editors and focuses on achieving legibility, durability, ease and flexibility.
