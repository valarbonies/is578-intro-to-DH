# About Data Cleaning Assignment

There are two datasets tied to this assignment that I was able to complete by using OpenRefine. 

For the first csv, I text filtered the full_text column to find all entries that used geospatial analysis. I wanted to look not just at one DH tool but at the type of analysis you could do with it. In this case, geospatial analysis. 

I experimented a bit more with the second csv by filtering the results first by country (Mexico), languages (Spanish), and work_type (poster / demo / art installation).

Additionally, I cleaned both datasets by eliminating the columns that had either one or no text in them. 

Here are the links to both datasets:
