# Mapping

I did assignment one using a dataset I created by web scraping all the Airbnb rentals in Puerto Rico (I used a free Airbnb Scraper tool available through Apify). I started out by uploading the dataset to kepler.gl and added a layer to represent all the rental locations as blue points in the map.

I then wanted to see the regions with the most Airbnb rentals by adding a layer of clusters.

Whe I activate both layers it looks like this:

I uploaded the same dataset to geojson
